# Accuracy of speed estimation using simulations

## Data simulation

In order to generate synthetic data sets under the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot process,
we used `phyrexsim`, which can be obtained by compiling PhyML code using `./configure --enable-phyrexsim`. From the current `simulations_speed_estimation` repository, do:

```
git clone git@github.com:stephaneguindon/phyml.git;
cd phyml;
sh ./autogen.sh;
./configure --enable-phyrexsim;
make;
cd ..;
mv phyml/src/phyrexsim phyrexsim;
```
The script `datagen.pl` then runs `phyrexsim` to produce the synthetic data:
```
perl ./datagen.pl
```
This produces the `.xml` files in the `ibm` folder, that are provided here for convenience.

## Data analysis

All simulated data sets were then processed with PhyREX on a computer server using `perl sim_ibm.pl`.
The script requires a working installation of PhyREX.

Finally, scatter plots of speed estimates vs. true values and MSE vs. true values were generated by running the `postprocess.R` file in R.
