# Accuracy of speed estimation using simulations

In order to generate synthetic data sets under the spatial Lambda-Fleming-Viot process, we used the following command: `perl ./datagen.pl`. This script runs `phyrexsim` which can be obtained by compiling PhyML code using `./configure --enable-phyrexsim`. This produces the `.xml` files in the `ibm` folder, that are provided here for convenience.

All simulated data sets were then processed with PhyREX on a computer server using `perl sim_ibm.pl`. 

Finally, scatter plots of speed estimates vs. true values and MSE vs. true values were generated by running the `postprocess.R` file in R.
